## Stateful v Stateless components

#### Learning Objectives
1. Explain the difference between a stateful and a stateless component.
2. Build a simple app using both kinds of components

### Intro

A coach will demonstrate building both kinds, and then have a quick Q&A.

### Main
Implement a simple react app!

##### Requirements
- I want to have three buttons called Red, Blue, Yellow.
- I want to have a heading "I am a Chameleon"
- I want to click on any of the buttons and for the heading text colour to change to the stated colour.

##### Instructions
1. Create a simple domain model
2. Use `create-react-app` to speed development
3. Spike code for this exercise.
4. Use both stateful and stateless components
